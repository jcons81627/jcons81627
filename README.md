## **Who is Vincent van Gogh?**

- Vincent van Gogh is a Dutch painter known as one of the greatest Post-Impressionists and widely regarded as the best after Rembrandt van Rijn. In his lifetime, he only only sold one piece of art, but a century after his passing, he rose to become arguably history's most well-known painter.

When naming Van Gogh's most well-known works, The Starry Night is probably at the top of everyone's list. It can be seen on anything, including posters, novelty socks, tote bags, computer backgrounds, tattooed arms, and more. Additionally, you can see it on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it serves as one of the institution's most eye-catching features (which is saying a lot given the number of other incredible paintings in MoMA's collection).

Not only is The Starry Night one of Van Gogh's most well-known works of art, but it's also among the most recognizable. Even today, viewers are still moved to tears by the incredible spiraling night sky that contains many expressionist spirals.
- ## **Sunflowers**

Sunflowers is actually two different series of numerous paintings of sunflowers, not simply one single artwork. The majority of the time, when someone mentions Van Gogh's "Sunflowers," they're referring to the series he produced while he was living in Arles, which includes four initial renditions and three variations on the theme.

Sunflowers appear to have completely pleased Van Gogh, as seen by the vast number of paintings he produced featuring them as well as his comments in letters to his brother and friends.
