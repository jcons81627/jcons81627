## **Who is Vincent van Gogh?**

Vincent van Gogh is a Dutch painter known as one of the greatest Post-Impressionists and widely regarded as the best after Rembrandt van Rijn. In his lifetime, he  only only sold one piece of art, but a century after his passing, he rose to become arguably history's most well-known painter.

- ## **`Starry Night (1889)`**

When naming Van Gogh's most well-known works, The Starry Night is probably at the top of everyone's list. It can be seen on anything, including posters, novelty socks, tote bags, computer backgrounds, tattooed arms, and more. Additionally, you can see it on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it serves as one of the institution's most eye-catching features (which is saying a lot given the number of other incredible paintings in MoMA's collection).

Not only is The Starry Night one of Van Gogh's most well-known works of art, but it's also among the most recognizable. Even today, viewers are still moved to tears by the incredible spiraling night sky that contains many expressionist spirals.
- ## **`Sunflowers (1888)`**

Sunflowers is actually two different series of numerous paintings of sunflowers, not simply one single artwork. The majority of the time, when someone mentions Van Gogh's "Sunflowers," they're referring to the series he produced while he was living in Arles, which includes four initial renditions and three variations on the theme. Less well known are the "Paris Sunflowers," which he produced between 1886 and 1888 while residing in Paris with his brother. The Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum, The Met in New York, and (of course) the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam all have sunflowers on display, albeit they are less triumphant and not quite in full bloom.

Sunflowers appear to have completely pleased Van Gogh, as seen by the vast number of paintings he produced featuring them as well as his comments in letters to his brother and friends.
- ## **`The Potato Eaters (1885)`**

Even though The Potato Eaters doesn't have the vibrant star power of some of his later works, it is nevertheless regarded as one of Van Gogh's most well-known works of art. This painting, which was created in 1885 and is a little earlier than the other works shown thus far, shows the artist's Dutch heritage. Van Gogh intended to portray the reality of peasant life as they actually were: rough, occasionally unpleasant, but also with a genuineness and tenderness inherent in the familial environment. He was greatly influenced by artists from the Hague School, particularly Jozef Israls.

It was a favorite of Van Gogh's. Two years after completing it, he claimed in a letter to his sister that "the picture I painted in Nuenen of the peasants eating potatoes is, in the end, the best thing I accomplished." The topic and execution of the painting were probably very dear to Van Gogh, and he was probably sincerely happy to have completed what he regarded as one of his masterpieces.
